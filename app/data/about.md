#### Intro

I am an up and coming Full Stack engineer who specializes in the Reactjs Framework, I have experience working on many different back end languages such as Ruby/Python/Nodejs and some Java (Although not to a professional level with Java)

I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interesting in projects revolving around data that affects the environment or helps people live a more simple lifestyle

#### Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2001 when I was 8. I used to work on Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint without the help of any internet and was nominated by my middle school to create all our teacher's projects.

- In highschool I took a liking towards C++ and decided to pursure Computer Science in college.

- After doing a couple years at college and struggling mostly with the advanced math classes I decided to pursue a coding bootcamp here in Seattle

- I immediately got 2 contracts after my bootcamp and worked at both simultaniously where I learned alot of the basics of professional web development.

- Eventually in 2020 I chose to move full time with Cabana but after 8 months and lack of funding due to the Covid 19 situation I was let go in November

- Now I am back again on the Hunt for a new Job.
